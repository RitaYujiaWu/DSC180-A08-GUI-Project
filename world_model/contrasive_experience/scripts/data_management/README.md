# Data Management Utilities

Scripts for organizing and analyzing trajectory datasets.

## Scripts

- **`check.py`** - Count trajectories by type (positive/negative/success) across all datasets
- **`count_number.py`** - Categorize trajectories into success/incomplete/admitted failure/other based on final response
- **`move_successful_files.py`** - Move successful trajectories to organized folders by domain
- **`move_fail_files.py`** - Move failed trajectories to organized folders by domain

## Usage

These scripts help organize raw trajectory data before building reasoning banks or training models.
