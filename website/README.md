# DSC180 A08 — Project Website (Q2 Checkpoint)

Static website for **Inference-Time Scaling for GUI Agents with Process Reward Models and Internal World Models** (DSC180 A08 Capstone, Quarter 2).

## Link to website

- **Live site (GitHub Pages):**  
  After enabling GitHub Pages for this repo (or for an artifact repo that contains this `website/` folder), the site will be available at:

  ```bash
  cd website && python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Contents

- **Introduction** — Motivation, GUI agents, inference-time scaling (PRM + world model).
- **Methods** — Part A (PRM pipeline), Part B (internal world model).  
  - *Placeholder:* PRM pipeline flow diagram.
- **Results** — PRM evaluation table (OSWorld), World Model evaluation table (WebVoyager).  
  - *Placeholder:* Agent benchmark table (planning benchmarks).
- **Conclusion** — Summary and impact.

Content is based on the project poster and Q2 report checkpoint. Placeholders are used for the flow diagram and agent benchmark table until final assets are ready.
